# Automatidata: Predicting Taxi Fares with Multiple Linear Regression & Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and modeling performed for Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm, in collaboration with the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). The project focuses on building a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using the TLC dataset and includes an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase.

## Project Overview

The New York City TLC wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data collected over a year. This model will help the TLC understand the factors influencing taxi fares and improve fare estimation. Additionally, the project includes a comprehensive EDA to uncover patterns and insights within the data.

## Scenario

As a data analyst at Automatidata, you are tasked with:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the TLC dataset to identify patterns, outliers, and potential issues.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to improve the model's predictive power.
3.  **Model Building:** Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance and interpret the results.
5.  **Provide Business Recommendations:** Offer insights and recommendations based on the model's findings.
6.  **Tableau Visualization:** Create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month.
7.  **Python Visualizations:** Generate various visualizations including box plots, histograms, and bar charts to understand the data.
8.  **Initial Data Inspection:** Perform a preliminary inspection of the dataset to identify data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
9.  **Variable Investigation:** Sort and interpret data for `trip_distance` and `total_amount` to identify unusual values.

* Investigate specific variables to uncover potential issues and insights.

## Key Tasks

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify outliers, missing data, and patterns.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features like `duration`, `mean_distance`, `mean_duration`, `day`, `month`, and `rush_hour`.
* **Model Building:** Develop and train a multiple linear regression model.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
* **Interpretation:** Interpret the model's coefficients and provide business insights.
* **Tableau Visualization:** Create a dashboard showing New York City map of taxi trips by month.
* **Python Visualizations:** Generate box plots, histograms, and bar charts.
* **Initial Data Inspection:** Inspect data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
* **Investigate Long Trips, High Fares, and Negative Fares**: Conduct detailed analysis on these specific data subsets.
* **Variable Investigation:** Sort and interpret `trip_distance` and `total_amount`.
